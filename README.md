# 📝 Next Notes App

A simple note management app built with **Next.js 15** and the new **App Router**.  
This is a hands-on pet project created to explore and practice the newest features of the framework, such as:

- ✅ App Router (layouts, nested and dynamic routing)
- ✅ Server Actions (no separate API endpoints!)
- ✅ Streaming UI with loading fallbacks
- ✅ Tailwind CSS for fast and flexible styling
- ✅ Metadata API for SEO optimization

## 📁 Tech Stack
